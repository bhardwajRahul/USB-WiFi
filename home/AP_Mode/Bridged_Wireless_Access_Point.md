Forword: This guide has been available for several years and has evolved over that time. This curent edition reflects my ongoing use and testing. My goal is to provide a guide that supports a stable, fast AP setup and an educational experience. This guide is used with and is mostly tested on Raspberry Pi OS (RasPiOS). RasPiOS, as of this writing, uses kernel 6.12 and is based on Debian 13. This guide should work with many Debian based distros on a variety of hardware, possibly with modifications in some cases. I strongly recommend that before you use this guide that you start with a clean distro installation. While this guide primarily uses the RasPiOS, other distros such as, but not limited to, Debian 12/13, Arch, Fedora or Ubuntu should work well. Your comments, suggestions and questions are always welcome (post in `Issues`).

## How to build a bridged wireless access point

What you will learn:

- Linux networking with `systemd-networkd`

- Establishing one or more Service Set Identifiers (SSID) with `hostapd`

A bridged wireless access point (aka dumb AP) works within an existing ethernet network to add WiFi capability where it does not exist or to extend the network to WiFi capable computers and devices in areas where the WiFi signal is weak or otherwise does not meet expectations. Another common use is to add another SSID that is on a different channel so as to reduce the load on an existing SSID. One big advantage of this setup is that it can cost far less than many of the Mesh kits that are available. Another advantage this setup has is that the Raspberry Pi is a general purpose computer so that it can be used for additional tasks while performing as a bridged wireless access point.

```
                                                  ((((( tablet    
                                                 ╱
INTERNET >>>>>>> modem/router >>>>>>> RasPi ))))) ((((( laptop/desktop
                (cable)         ╱                ╲
                (fiber)       CAT 5e+             ((((( phone
                (dsl)         Powerline AV2        ╲
                (satellite)   Ethernet Over Coax    ((((( IoT
 ```

Note: In a situation where only another SSID is needed on a different channel or when adding WiFi capability is all that is needed, a very short CAT 5e+ cable may be all that is required as the RasPi can be plugged directly into the modem or router.

Note: In a situation where the RasPi needs to be located a long distance from the modem or router, the connection from the router to the RasPi is best served by a CAT 5e or greater ethernet cable but alternatives exist. One alternative is to use your existing electrical wiring by using Powerline AV2 adapters. These adapters are also called Homeplug AV2 adapters and come in a variety of speeds and prices. I have had success with Powerline AV2 adapters, such as the TP-Link AV2000 TL-PA9020P KIT, but success depends on the quality and setup of the electrical wiring to be used. Another option is Ethernet Over Coax (MoCa). Anyone considering Powerline AV2 or Ethernet Over Coax (MoCa) should research the products and be prepared to return the products if expectations are not met.

Note: If you are looking to set up a Routed Wireless Access Point, my recommendation is to use OpenWRT. Here is a video that may be helpful:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pBf2hGqXL8

Information that is helpful with OpenWRT if you intend to use a USB WiFi adapter: OpenWRT has driver packages for several Mediatek/Ralink chipsets to include the mt7925u, mt7925e, mt7921u, mt7921e, mt7612u and mt7610u. These drivers work well but do not support DFS channels for AP mode on the 5 GHz band. Realtek out-of-kernel drivers are a real challenge on OpenWRT and are best avoided. As of kernel 6.14, in-kernel drivers for the rtl8812au and rtl8821/11au chips have been added. As of kernel 6.16, an in-kernel driver for the rtl8814au chip has been added. Additionally, many other Realtek WiFi 5 drivers have been improved to the point in rtw88 that performance is good. Hopefully this Realtek rtw88 WiFi 5 support can be added to OpenWRT at some point but until that happens, you should probably use adapters with Mediatek chipsets. Additionally, at this time, I recommend that you avoid Realtek WiFi 6 and 7 USB adapters.

#### Single Band or Dual Band - Your Choice

This document outlines single band and dual band WiFi setups using a Raspberry Pi 4B. There is a lot of flexibility and capability available with this type of setup.

Important: USB WiFi adapters contain only one internal radio. For a dual band setup, you need two usb wifi adapters or one usb wifi adapter and the RasPi internal wifi active. I do not recommend the internal wifi on RasPi's as the quality of the drivers is suspect.

Note: Tri Band should work but I have not tested it.

#### Tested Setup

Raspberry Pi 4B (4gb)

Raspberry Pi OS (with Desktop) (64 bit) - Strongly recommend that you start with a fresh installation.

Ethernet cable or Powerline AV2 providing internet connectivity

USB WiFi Adapter(s)

Case

Right Angle USB Extender

Power Supply

SD Card

Note: I use the case upside down with little stick-on rubber feet. There are several little things that work better with the case upside down and no negatives that I can find.

Note: Historically speaking, very few Powered USB 3 Hubs will work well with Raspberry Pi hardware. Raspberry Pi now offers a Raspberry Pi USB 3 Powered Hub for sale. I do not own one at this time so cannot say whether it is good or not. Here is a list of possible problems with Powered USB 3 Hubs:

Backfeeding of current into the Raspberry Pi USB subsystem.

Bugs in the USB3 hub chipset. (Raspberry Pi leadership has a history of making bad hardware decisions)

Another problem with the Raspberry Pi 4B USB subsystem is that it is designed to supply a maximum of 1200 mA of power. This is WELL BELOW the specification which calls for 2800 mA in a setup such as on the RasPi4B. It is very easy to exceed this 1200 mA limit.

Note: The rtl88XXxu chipset based USB3 WiFi adapters require from 504 mA of power up to well over 800 mA of power depending on the adapter. Beware of the power hungry Realtek USB WiFi adapters.

Let me repeat: The Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+ and 4B USB subsystems are only able to supply a total of 1200 mA of power total to be divided between all attached devices.

Note: The Alfa AWUS036ACM adapter, a mt7612u based adapter, requests a maximum of 400 mA from the USB subsystem during initialization. Testing with a meter shows actual usage of 360 mA during heavy load and usage of 180 mA during light loads. This is much lower power usage than most AC1200 class adapters which makes this adapter a good choice for a Raspberry Pi based access points. Other mt7612u and mt7610u chipset based adapters also show low power usage. Even the newer WiFi 6 mt7921au chipset is a low power chipset so will work well with this setup. Another adapter that is very good for use in this setup is the Alfa AWUS036ACHM which is an AC600 class adapter that has very impressive range.

#### Setup Steps

USB WiFi adapter driver installation, if required, should be performed prior to continuing.

Note: New and updated Realtek WiFi 5 in-kernel (mac80211) drivers are available in the rtw88 series of drivers. If using a rtl8812au or rtl8821/11au based adapter, the driver went into kernel 6.14. If using a rtl8814au based adapter, the driver went into kernel 6.16. If using other Realtek WiFi 5 adapters, it is recommended that you use kernel 6.12 or later. If you are using an older kernel, it is possible to install the rtw88, in its modern form, from the following repo:

https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw88

The following instructions apply to Realtek out-of-kernel drivers:

Note: For USB3 adapters based on the Realtek rtl8812au, rtl8812bu and rtl8814au chipsets, the following module parameters may be needed for best performance when the adapter is set to support 5 GHz band: (if using a rtl8812bu based adapter with a Raspberry Pi 4B or 400, you may need to limit USB mode to USB2 due to a bug, probably in the Raspberry Pi OS, that causes dropped connections-- rtw_switch_usb_mode=2)

rtw_vht_enable=2 rtw_switch_usb_mode=1

Note: For USB2 adapters based on the Realtek rtl8811au and rtl8821cu chipset, the following module parameters may be needed for best performance when the adapter is set to support 5 GHz band:

rtw_vht_enable=2

Note: For USB3 adapters based on the Realtek rtl8812au, rtl8812bu and rtl8814au chipsets, the following module parameters may be needed for best performance when the adapter is set to support 2.4 GHz band:

rtw_vht_enable=1 rtw_switch_usb_mode=2

Note: For USB2 adapters based on the Realtek rtl8811au and rtl8821cu chipset, the following module parameters may be needed for best performance when the adapter is set to support 2.4 GHz band:

rtw_vht_enable=1

The following instruction apply to the Mediatek mt7612u and mt7921u in-kernel drivers:

The following module parameter may be needed for stable performance:

disable_usb_sg=1

Note: Here is a quick way to set the disable_usb_sg parameter:

sudo -i
echo "options mt76_usb disable_usb_sg=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/mt76_usb.conf
exit

Note: More information is available at the following site:

-----

#### Update, upgrade and clean up of the RasPiOS. Other distros may require different commands.

Note: Upgrading the operating system is not mandatory for this installation but it is a good idea.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt autoremove
```

-----

#### Reduce overall power consumption.

Note: All items in this step are optional and some items are specific to the Raspberry Pi 4B. If installing to other Raspberry Pi hardware, you will need to use the appropriate settings for that hardware.

```
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
```

Note: The config.txt file may be located as shown below in older versions of the RasPiOS.

```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Change: (optional, the below change adds a comment character in order to disable audio)

```
# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
#dtparam=audio=on

```

Add: (after `[all]`)

```

# Disable Power LED
dtparam=pwr_led_trigger=default-on
dtparam=pwr_led_activelow=off

# Disable Activity LED
dtparam=act_led_trigger=none
dtparam=act_led_activelow=off

# Disable Ethernet port LEDs
dtparam=eth_led0=4
dtparam=eth_led1=4

# Disable onboard Bluetooth
dtoverlay=disable-bt

# Disable onboard WiFi
dtoverlay=disable-wifi

```

-----

Overclock the CPU a modest amount.

Note: This step is optional and is specific to the Raspberry Pi 4B.

```
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
```

Note: The config.txt file may be located as shown below in older versions of the RasPiOS.

```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Add:

```
# Overclock CPU
# (may not be required with later versions of the RasPi4B)
over_voltage=2
arm_freq=1800
```

-----

#### Predictable network interface names

The Raspberry Pi OS currently does not use predictable network interface names. WiFi interface names will appear as wlan0, wlan1, etc.

Note: While this step is optional, problems can arise without it on dual band setups. Some Linux distros have this capability enabled by default but not the Raspberry Pi OS. My recommendation is that you activate Predictable Network Interface Names.

To enable predictable network interface names on the Raspberry Pi OS:

```
sudo raspi-config
```

Select: Advanced options > A4 Network Interface Names > Yes

Reboot system.

```
sudo reboot
```

-----

#### How to handle Network Manager (NM)

If your Linux distro uses Network Manager (NM), as does current versions of the RasPiOS, then NM needs to be configured to NOT manage the interface that you plan to use as an AP. If this is not accomplished, you will have problems as NM will fight hostapd for control of the wireless interface.

How to keep Network Manager from causing problems.

Tell Network Manager to ignore a specific wireless interface.

```
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
```

add

```
[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=interface-name:wlan0
```

Note: Ensure that you change `wlan0` to the name of your
wireless interface.

Save the file.

Note: Netplan can also cause problems if you use Ubuntu server.  If you are using Ubuntu server, there is a section at the end of this guide that shows you how to remove Netplan. 

#### Determine name and state of the network interfaces.

```
ip a
```

You may need to additionally run the following command to help to determine which adapter, in a dual band setup, has which interface name.

```
iw dev
```

Note: If the interface names are not eth0, wlan0 and wlan1, then the interface names used in your system will have to replace eth0, wlan0 and wlan1 for the remainder of this document.

-----

#### Install hostapd package.

```
sudo apt install hostapd
```

-----

#### Enable systemd-networkd service. Website - [SystemdNetworkd](https://wiki.debian.org/SystemdNetworkd)

Install and configure systemd-resolved.

```
sudo apt install systemd-resolved
```

```
sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved
```

```
sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved
```

Once started, systemd-resolved will create its own resolv.conf somewhere under /run/systemd directory. However, it is a common practice to store DNS resolver information in /etc/resolv.conf, and many applications still rely on /etc/resolv.conf. Thus for compatibility reason, create a symlink to /etc/resolv.conf as follows.

```
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
```

```
sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```

Enable systemd-networkd.

```
sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd
```

-----

#### Create bridge interface br0.

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/10-create-bridge-br0.netdev
```

File contents

```
[NetDev]
Name=br0
Kind=bridge
```

Bind ethernet interface.

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/20-bind-ethernet-with-bridge-br0.network
```

File contents

```
[Match]
Name=eth0

[Network]
Bridge=br0
```

#### Configure bridge interface.

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/30-config-bridge-br0.network
```

Note: The contents of the Network block below should reflect the needs of your network.

File contents

```
[Match]
Name=br0

[Network]
#DHCP=yes
Address=192.168.1.24/24
Gateway=192.168.1.1
#DNS=8.8.8.8
```

-----

#### Enable the wireless access point service and set it to start when your Raspberry Pi boots.

```
sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
```

```
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
```

-----

#### Create hostapd configuration file(s)

Note: The below steps include creating two hostapd configurations files but only one is needed if using a single band setup.

Note: Shown below are hostapd.conf examples for WiFi 4 and WiFi 5 adapters. An example for WiFi 6 is shown at [`./hostapd-WiFi6.conf`](./hostapd-WiFi6.conf).

Create hostapd configuration file for 5 GHz band.

```
sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd-WiFi5.conf
```

How to keep Network Manager from causing problems.

Option 1:

Tell Network Manager to ignore specific devices.

```
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
```

add

```
[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=interface-name:wlan0
```

Note: Remember to replace wlan0 with your interface name.

Option 2:

Uninstall NetworkManager.

Note: For systems not running the Gnome desktop, purging Network Manager is the easiest solution.

```
sudo apt purge network-manager
```

Note: For systems running the Gnome desktop, use the following.

```
sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
```

```
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager.service
```

```
sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager-wait-online.service
```

```
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service
```

```
sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager-dispatcher.service
```

```
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-dispatcher.service
```

```
sudo systemctl stop network-manager.service
```

How do I disable Wayland so that I can use VNC?

Note: Raspberry Pi OS 2023-10-10 uses Wayland by default but the included VNC server does not support Wayland so it is necessary to return to X11 if you want VNC to work.

Open Terminal on the Pi, or connect to it using SSH

Run the command: sudo raspi-config

Select Advanced Options, then select Wayland

Select X11 and confirm

Reboot the Pi when prompted
